{"name":"Apm-mavlink-to-frsky","tagline":"Arducopter Mavlink telemetry to FrSky Taranis","body":"### Arducopter Mavlink telemetry to FrSky Taranis.\r\nThis project was created to get telemetry data from the APM down to my Taranis radio. Using an Arduino Pro mini we can read Mavlink data from the APM and translate this to the FrSky hub telemetry protocol. This means that this will only work with FrSky receivers that support the old telemetry protocol, D4R-II, D8R-XP etc. A S.Port implementation for the X8R will be implemented as soon as someone hacks the protocol.\r\n\r\n### Data currently sent to the Taranis is:\r\nAlt      Altitude from ARM point\r\nRpm      Throttle out\r\nFuel     Battery remaining\r\nT1       APM mode\r\nT2       Sat fix and count. 38 means 3d fix and 8 sats, 04 means no fix and 4 sats\r\nSpd      GPS speed over ground in knots\r\nDist     -\r\nGAlt     GPS Altitude\r\nCell     -\r\nCels     Battery voltage\r\nVfas     -\r\nCurr     Battery current\r\nCnsp     mAh used totalizer (calculated value in the Taranis)               \r\nPowr     Power (calculated value in the Taranis)\r\nAccX     Attitude pitch\r\nAccY     Attitude roll\r\nAccZ     Attitude yaw\r\nHdg      Heading\r\n\r\n### How to use\r\nThere are two ways to use this. Either by enabling the UART2 port on the APM or by sharing the TX line with the 3DR radio.\r\n\r\n## Using UART2 port\r\nThis way you dont have to connect with the 3dr radio to get the mavlink data going. The Arduino will make a mavlink rate request to the APM.\r\nThis is done by modifying system.pde around line 149 to look like this(AC 3.1RC7). \r\n`//#if CONFIG_HAL_BOARD != HAL_BOARD_APM2\r\n    // we have a 2nd serial port for telemetry on all boards except\r\n    // APM2. We actually do have one on APM2 but it isn't necessary as\r\n    // a MUX is used\r\n    hal.uartC->begin(map_baudrate(g.serial3_baud, SERIAL3_BAUD), 128, 128);\r\n    gcs3.init(hal.uartC);\r\n//#endif`\r\nA precompiled 3.1rc7 for quads can be found [here](https://github.com/vizual54/APM-Mavlink-to-FrSky/tree/master/Binaries)\r\n\r\n## Sharing UART0 with 3DR radio\r\nThis way you always have to connect with the 3dr radio to get data to the Taranis but you dont have to modify the code and build arducopter yourself.\r\nHere is how to connect it.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
